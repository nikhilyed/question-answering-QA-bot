# QA Bot - PDF Question Answering with IBM Watsonx AI

This project is a **Question Answering (QA) Bot** that allows users to upload a PDF document and ask questions about its content. The bot uses **IBM Watsonx Foundation Models** for natural language understanding and **LangChain** to process, split, and retrieve relevant text from documents. The interface is built using **Gradio** for a simple web-based UI.

---

## 🔹 Features

- Upload a PDF document and interactively ask questions.
- Uses **Watsonx LLM** to generate answers.
- Splits documents into chunks for efficient retrieval.
- Embeds document chunks using **Watsonx Embeddings**.
- Stores embeddings in a **Chroma vector database** for fast retrieval.
- Clean and user-friendly **Gradio interface**.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **IBM Watsonx AI** – Foundation models for text generation and embeddings.
- **LangChain** – Document loading, text splitting, vector storage, and QA chains.
- **Gradio** – Web-based interface for user interaction.
- **Hugging Face Hub** – For model management and authentication.
- **Python 3.10+** – Core programming language.

## ⚡ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. **Install required packages:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure `requirements.txt` contains:
```
ibm-watsonx-ai
langchain
langchain-community
huggingface_hub
gradio
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the QA Bot application:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open the web interface in your browser (default: `http://localhost:7860`).
3. Upload a PDF file.
4. Type your query in the input box and submit.
5. Receive answers generated by the AI based on the document content.

**Note:** If you are using an IDE where IBM Watsonx credentials are already configured, no extra credentials are needed. Otherwise, you can provide credentials when creating the model instance in the code.

## ⚠️ Notes

- The bot works best with **text-heavy PDFs**.
- For large PDFs, the chunk size and overlap in `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` can be adjusted.
